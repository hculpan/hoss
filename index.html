            <p>So it’s been about a year since the last time I worked on HOSS, and I’ve decided to start playing around with it again.</p>
<p>The first issue I faced was that my toolchain no longer worked.  When I went to rebuild HOSS, I got an error from GCC that it could not find a library that it needed.  As you may remember, I was following a tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Fenollosa</a> that was specific to writing an OS on a Mac.  Among the various steps, he talked about building a cross-compiling version of GCC.  The version he used was 4.9, but I used a slightly later version, 6.x, for my initial HOSS work.  Even at the time I did this, GCC had advanced well beyond version 6, but I specifically chose to use an older version.  I don’t quite remember why, other than a vague notion that for some reason later versions of GCC wouldn’t work.  I don’t recall why I thought this, but that’s why I stuck with such an old version.</p>
<p>Well, when I got the missing library error, I was kind of screwed.  After doing some Googling, I didn’t come up with anything definitive, but I got the impression that the library disappeared when I upgraded my version of mac OS.  So I decided to switch to the latest GCC.  I downloaded version 9.2, followed Fenollosa’s instructions, and with only a few hiccups, everything worked.  The hiccups came from three libraries which I had installed with Brew, but their headers and libs weren’t in the normal include/lib paths.  Fortunately the build process told me what to do, which was pass in some extra parameters, and once I did that everything worked.</p>
<p>So with my toolchain once again functioning, I rebuilt HOSS and started working on it again.</p>
<p>The next issue I ran into was that apparently my Bochs configuration was screwed up.  It was pointing to a file, <code>hoss-os.img</code>, which wasn’t being generated when I did a <code>make all</code>.  At first I thought I had just renamed the file to <code>os-image</code>, but I finally figured out that I had added a target to generate a full 1.44mb floppy image, including <code>os-image</code> in that floppy image.  This is what I would use in Bochs and VirtualBox.  The problem was, my Makefile target <code>run-bochs</code> had <code>os-image</code> as a dependency, not <code>image</code> which is what generated <code>hoss-os.img</code>.  So I fixed that, and everything worked.  And I bumped up my Bochs configuration to 2gb ram to match what I was doing in QEMU.</p>
<h2 id="Memory-Managerment"><a href="#Memory-Managerment" class="headerlink" title="Memory Managerment"></a>Memory Managerment</h2><p>So where I stopped before was in the middle of working on my memory manager.  I had written a simple memory manager using a simple First Fit algorithm, but I hadn’t thoroughly tested it.  I have a command shell program.  It does very little, just presents a command prompt where you can type anything.  And it only supports a few commands, none of them actually useful for anything other than testing my memory manager.  Two commands, <code>alloc</code> and <code>free</code>, simply allocate 4k of ram and then free it.  You could call <code>alloc</code> multiple times, and it would allocate multiple 4k blocks, and it would display the allocated segment blocks.<br><img src="images/alloc.png" alt><br>The problem was that <code>free</code> would only free the last allocated block of memory.  But that wouldn’t test all the scenarios that I needed to test, of course.  So my first change was to make it so that it would free the allocated blocks in reverse order, i.e., you could call it multiple times and it would free the allocated blocks in the reverse order of how you allocated them.  Doing so and running some tests proved that my memory manager could allocate and free blocks without losing track.</p>
<p>But this didn’t really cover a more real world scenario, of course.  I didn’t know what would happen if I, say, allocated three blocks, and then freed the one in the middle.  The next time I allocated a 4k block, would it pick the one in the middle?  Would it add it to the end, skipping the empty block?  I needed to be able to arbitrarily free any memory block in whatever oder I chose.</p>
<p>This took more work than I expected.  The first issue was that my simple command interpreter really just did simple string matching to execute commands.  This meant that it couldn’t support parameters, other than where the parameter was essentially part of the command.  For example, I had a command called <code>memmap</code> which would show me the memory map of usable memory that the system provided.  But I also had <code>memmap full</code>, which would also show unusable/reserved memory.  But this parameter was just done through simple string matching.  There was no real parsing going on.  But to get <code>free</code> to do what I needed, I would have to do some parsing.</p>
<p>Not a big deal, of course, but one of the aspects of writing your own operating system is that you have no library of functions to fall back on except whatever you write.  So deciding that <code>free</code> would accept an optional numeric parameter, which would be the index of the block you wanted to free, I ended up having to write my own versions of <code>strtok</code> and <code>atoi</code> and added these to my libc module.</p>
<p>Once I did that, updating my command shell was pretty simple, so that now I could do this:<br><img src="images/alloc_and_free.png" alt></p>
<p>I am pleased to report that my memory manager passed every test I came up with.  In the image above, for example, you can see on free block of size 2009.  This is because I had allocated a bunch of blocks and then removed two in the middle, which it then correctly blended into one free block.  Another test I ran, though it’s not obvious from this screenshot, is to allocate a block after having freed some, and it correctly allocated the new block in the middle of existing blocks, rather than going to the end of the memory chain.  I still have some more work to do on my command shell and some more testing, but so far the memory manager is looking pretty good.</p>
<p>One small semi-ironic part that came up during this work is that I don’t currently have any way of dynamically allocating memory from within the shell.  Ideally, of course, I could just have it use the memory manager, but my memory manager is a chunk allocator, meaning it only allocates into bigger blocks of 4k and up.  I assumed applications would use a suballocator to divide this memory up into smaller chunks for application use.  But I don’t have such a suballocator written, so right now there’s no way for the shell to dynamically allocate, say, 20 bytes for a string.  I’ll probably finish my testing on the HOSS memory manager, and then build a simple suballocator for the shell.  Hopefully I can build it in such a way that I can reuse it for applications.</p>

            <p>Over the last week or so, I’ve been working on a memory manager.  It was the next fundamental step for my kernel, something I really needed to do before anything else, so I was anxious to get it done.</p>
<p>My first effort didn’t work out that well and, in retrospect, was pretty stupid.  If you recall from my prior post, I had gotten the system memory map.  This gave me a view on what memory was available and what wasn’t.  The way it appeared, all memory above 1mb was available in one continguous chunk, while below 1mb it was more fragmented.  So I made the easy choice that for heap memory, I would ignore everything below 1mb.</p>
<p>With that decided, I started in to writing my memory manager.  I created a structure called <code>Memory_Segment</code> that had basic information: The starting address of a segment, length, type (for the moment, just free, system, or user), and pointers to the left and right segment descriptor.  Deciding that I would limit allocation to 4k segments, I created a solid block of memory to store an array of these, with enough memory allocated to manage the entire available memory.  This block started at 1mb, with the actual free ram located above this system block.</p>
<p>This was a very poor approach though.  I had an array of structures, but because I wanted to do a buddy allocation scheme, I was also treating them as a tree.  Mixing a dynamic tree structure with an array was a bad idea, and predictably it failed.  I could allocate memory pretty easily, but freeing became onerous.</p>
<p>After a good night’s sleep, I decided to scrap what I had and start over.  I came up with a far more rational - and, I suspect, more standard - approach.  Rather than storing the segment discriptor in a block set aside for that purpose, I decided to store the descriptor with the allocated memory as a header.  So I altered my descriptor structure to a simpler and shorter format, containing just the length, type, and pointer to previous.  My pointer to next could be calculated by simpling added the address of the descriptor with the size of the structure and length of that memory block.  This gave me a linked list of memory blocks, and made writing a first fit allocator pretty straightforward.  The only other thing I had to do was add a descriptor with type TYPE_EOM and length of 0 at the end of memory, which gave me a clean marker to end the list.</p>
<h3 id="Bochs"><a href="#Bochs" class="headerlink" title="Bochs"></a>Bochs</h3><p>So far, I’ve been using QEMU almost exclusively for development, with a little testing in VirtualBox and an attempt in VMWare Fusion.  In the last, I get a CPU fault, which I’ve not bothered to try to track down yet.  With VirtualBox, I get a very different error.  Everything works, but it seems to lose some keyboard strokes.  I can type a letter and sometimes it works and sometimes nothing happens.</p>
<p>I didn’t think too much about it, as everything worked just great in QEMU.  But for some reason I decided to get Bochs to work.  The issue with Bochs, for those who haven’t used it, is there doesn’t seem to be a simple way to start.  Obviously there’s the documentation, but for someone who’s trying to get something done, this is pretty onerous.  I finally found a video that discussed about editing and saving properties, and then another that discussed basic commands.  So with that, I pretty quickly had Bochs up and running with my os image.</p>
<p>But the thing was, it had the same keyboard behavior as I saw in VirtualBox.  When I ignored it earlier with VirtualBox, I kind of wrote it off to, “It works in QEMU, but not in VB, but I don’t know which one is more correct behavior.  So worry about it later.”  But with Bochs acting like VB, that kind of suggested that QEMU was probably not accurate.</p>
<p>I spent a while trying to track it down, and of course went straight to my interrupt handler routine for the keyboard.  At the moment, my keyboard device driver does two very basic things.  It manages the state of the Shift, Ctrl, and Alt keys, and it maps scancodes to ASCII characters.  It has two basic external methods, <code>waitForAscii</code> and <code>waitForScancode</code>.  Both are blocking, and they just loop until a key is pressed.  Obviously this won’t be sufficient in the long term, but it meets my needs for now.<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">char waitForAscii() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    char result = 0;</span><br><span class="line">    while (!result) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        result = last_ascii;</span><br><span class="line">        last_ascii = 0;</span><br><span class="line">        last_scancode = 0;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    return result;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>This is pretty simple.  The only thing that might need some explanation is the <code>last_ascii</code> and the <code>last_scancode</code> variables.  These are just driver-level variables that are set by the interrupt handler to the scancode and the mapped ascii code, if it maps to ascii.  Appropriate use of kprint statements allows me to eliminate the interrupt handler, so I came to this function next.  It took me a bit of thought, but I finally realized what was going on.  The interrupt handler could fire at any point in this function, including in between, say, the setting of <code>result</code> and resetting <code>last_ascii</code>.  This is, of course, very similar to problems with multithreading code, so I really should have seen this right away.  In any case, the answer was reasonably simple.  Just disable and enable interrupts at the appropriate times, as so:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">while (!result) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    asm volatile(&quot;cli&quot;);</span><br><span class="line">    result = last_ascii;</span><br><span class="line">    last_ascii = 0;</span><br><span class="line">    last_scancode = 0;</span><br><span class="line">    asm volatile(&quot;sti&quot;);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>So now keyboard input works consistently in QEMU, VirtualBox, and Bochs.</p>
<p>But all is still not golden.  There’s still the CPU fault in VMWare Fusion, of course, though for the moment I’m willing to ignore this.  More concerning is that I have a memory allocation problem with VB.  Right now, I have a little test in my shell that allows me to type <code>alloc</code> and it will just allocate 4k on the heap and display the resulting memory segment chain.  On QEMU and Bochs, I can seemingly do this all day long with no problem.  On VB, it locks up and often prints strange things on the screen.  A new problem to look at, but that’s for another post.</p>

            <p>Over the last two days, I’ve been contemplating my next steps with the OS, with the two most obvious choices being memory manager or floppy drive interface.  But pretty quickly I settled on the memory manager as the more fundamental component.  As the OS is now, I have full control over memory even in my “user” shell program (I haven’t implemented any sort of protection yet), and with a 32-bit memory model, I clearly have enough space to load a whole floppy into memory many times over.  But I feel like I wouldn’t get too far before I’d want to have some way to allocate and track memory.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’ve been looking at various sources for an approach to memory management, but the best I’ve found is Tannenbaum’s book, “Modern Operating Systemns”.  Based on that, I’ve decided to go with a page allocator using the buddy algorithm.  This is just for physical memory, of course; I have no plans to implement virtual memory, as I can’t imagine this project getting big enough that I’d ever need it.  When I launch QEMU to test HOSS, I’m already allocating 1gb.  This is way less than my computer actually has, of course, so I’ve got plenty of room to grow.  But at the moment, 1gb seems like more memory than I could possibly use.  So just physical ram it is!</p>
<p>The first step in constructing a memory manager, though, is to figure out how much ram I actually have.  My first attempt at googling brought me to a page discussing BIOS interrupt 15h, function E801h.  The nice thing is, this is quite simple and only took me a minute or two to add to my <code>boot/boot_sect.asm</code> file.  The only wrinkle I found here was that, since it’s a BIOS call, I had to call it from my 16-bit boot loader, but how to get it to my 32-bit kernel?  I solved that just by adding a variable to my boot loader.  Since I wanted to be sure I knew what address it would be at, since I would have to hard code the address in my 32-bit kernel, I put it at the top of the boot loader, not the bottom.  Thus the top of <code>boot/boot_sect.asm</code> became:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[org 0x7c00]</span><br><span class="line">KERNEL_OFFSET equ 0x1000</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">[bits 16]</span><br><span class="line">    jmp boot_start</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">MEMORY_SIZE     dd 0x00000000</span><br><span class="line">BOOT_DRIVE      db  0</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">boot_start:</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>By doing this, I knew that MEMORY_SIZE would be at 7C02h, because <code>jmp boot_start</code> when assembled would take up only 2 bytes.  This added the tiny overhead of a small jump, but since I will likely use FAT12/16 as my file system, I will need to put a structure at the top of the boot loader in any case.</p>
<p>With that done, I simply created an <code>int *</code> in my kernel and hard coded the address to 7C02h, and viola I had the amount of available ram.</p>
<p>But there’s a wrinkle to this simple solution.  While it tells me how much ram is free, it doesn’t tell me where it is.  At first I was going to hard code this, but then I found the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OS Dev Wiki</a> and it’s explanation for <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Detecting_Memory_(x86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detecting memory</a>).  It discussed function E801h, of course, but indicated that E820h is really the standard function for finding available information.  Rather than giving you a since amount of available memory, it gaves you a table of memory ranges, indicating which are usable and which are not.</p>
<p>E820h definitely took some time to understand, and even though they had two sample implementations (one in assembly, the other C), it took me a while to figure out the particulars.  But though the E820h call has a number of peculariaties, overall it’s pretty straightforward.  You call the function repeatedly with each call giving you the next entry in the table.  Each entry gives you the starting address of the memory block, the length, and the type (1 = usable, anything else meaning not).  Using the example assembler code, I had an integer value (4 bytes) at 8000h, which was the number of entries.  The table was put right after this, with each entry being a total of 24 bytes in length.  Thus the first entry was at 8004h, the second at 801Ch, and so on.  So it was a simple matter in the kernel to hard code another <code>int *</code> to 8000h.  I then created a struct to match the layout of the table entries, created a pointer to the struct hard coded to 8004h, and then just treated the table as an array.  Very simple.</p>
<p>But it didn’t quite work out.  I kept getting very odd values.  For example, my first memory block was a usable segment at address 0, but it was only 2 bytes long.  And the vast bulk of memory was in an unusable block, also starting at 0.  The documentation warned that there could be overlap, but this was ridiculous.  I did some further searching and found that others had had similar problems, and the resolution had been to pack the struct.  Basically the concern was that the optimizer was trying to align the 64-bit entries along 8-byte boundaries.  I tried adding <code>__attribute((packed))__</code>, but this didn’t change anything.  I also tried breaking the 64-bit numbers into two 32-bit numbers, especially since the numbers I was dealing with would all fit easily in the lower portion.  But while that changed the numbers, they still were pretty screwed up.</p>
<p>My final solution was a bit of a kludge, but it worked.  Rather than using a struct, I just used pointer arithmetic.  So I set my base pointer address to 8004h.  As I looked through the entries, I just changed the base pointer to <code>8004h + (index * 24)</code>.  And then I’d add the offset for the specific value location.  For example, the length is the second 64-bit value in the entry, so it’s address was <code>8004h + 8 + (index * 24)</code>.  Once I did that, everything worked.</p>
<p><img src="images/mem_map.png" alt></p>
<p>My final bit of work on this was to add support to the shell for the commands <code>memmap</code> and <code>memmap full</code>, which showed the map of usable memory and of all memory, respectively.</p>
<p>At the end of all this, as I was doing final testing, I came across a bit of a vexing problem.  I had added a block in the kernel to display available memory as it started up.  I outputted this in decimal rather than hex, and I wanted it separated with commas, as it’s easier to read.  This necessitated adding several new functions and code blocks.  None of it a big deal, except suddenly my shell stopped functioning correctly.  It stopped outputting the prompt <code>&gt;</code> and the intro text, but you could still type and it would output what you typed.  I backed out all of my code, of course, and the problem went away.  But after scanning the code and seeing no issue, I put it back but removed the code that called it.  So it would be a part of my OS image, but not actually called.  My problem came back.  I concocted theories of memory being overwritten and that sort of thing, all of which turned out to lead nowhere.  What it turned out to be is that my boot loader would load up 15 sectors off the boot disk, but my os-image had grown to 25 sectors.  So it wasn’t loaded a big chunk of it into memory.  Obviously the fix was simple, just load more sectors into memory.  Since it doesn’t give an error if those sectors don’t exist (i.e., if the os-image file is only 10k in size, ~20 sectors, but you say load 30, it will just load what it can find and give no error), I set it to load 50 sectors.  Honestly, I probably should have gone higher, but c’est la vie.  </p>
<p>If my kernel grows much larger, I’ll probably start looking into doing a multi-stage loader (i.e., load boot sector first, which loads pre-kernel, which then loads final runtime kernel).  By the time I get to this point, though, I presumably will have a file system that I can read for my final kernel.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned in my last post, the keyboard driver that Fenollosa gave in his tutorial had basic test code that would track a buffer, output the keys as pressed to the display, and process the simple command <code>END</code>.  I refactored that code to move it out of the keyboard driver, paring it down just to what was needed to support the keyboard.  While at this point I obviously don’t have applications or a way for them to call an OS-level API, I still wanted to encapsulate the keyboard so that it would be simple for calling processes to access.</p>
<p>The result of this is that I refactored all the extraneous code out of the keyboard driver, and originally gave it a new home in the <code>kernel_main</code> function.  But obviously this really isn’t part of the kernel.</p>
<p>I created a new directory, <code>shell</code>, with a new main file, <code>shell.c</code>.  Thus I started the beginning of my OS’s main command shell.  </p>
<p>Right now, it’s not much.  It still has the same little typewriter-like functionality that the original keyboard driver had.  But I’ve added a command, <code>scancode</code>, that will put the shell into a mode where it will output the scancode of whatever character is pressed or released.</p>
<p>While doing this, I also went ahead and addressed some of the shortcomings of my keyboard driver.  I added a <code>waitForScancode</code> function, so a user program can get any key.  I also added flags for the Ctrl, Alt, and CapsLock keys.  The Caps Lock key turned out to be a bit more difficult than I had anticipated.  Unlike the other keys, the Caps Lock really only effects a subset of keys, <code>a</code> through <code>z</code>.  But the numeric keys, for example, aren’t effected.  Even further, if you have Caps Lock enabled but then hold Shift, that reverts a letter to lowercase.  None of this is inherent to the keyboard, of course, and I could have chosen to do it differently in my OS, but I’m a strong believer in standard keyboards.  One of my biggest annoyances when playing with old computers like the Apple II and Commodore 64 is their non-standard keyboards.  So to fully support all this functionality turned out to be a bit trickier than I thought.  My scancode-to-ASCII conversion logic probably doubled in size.  But it wasn’t that big to begin with, so it’s not a big deal.  Just took a number of code-compile-test cycles to finally get it all right.</p>
<p>The only things left on the keyboard driver are to turn off the Caps Lock indicator on startup (right now, the driver assumes Caps Lock is off), and add application functions for polling.</p>

            <p>So the keyboard device driver has been the most fun thing I’ve worked on so far, mostly just because it’s been where I’ve been able to break away from other people’s code and start doing my own thing with HOSS.</p>
<p>I started with the basic driver that Fenollosa presented (this being on area where Brundell had a reference in his table of contents but no text).  Really, this was just test code.  It setup a keyboard interrupt handler, converted the scancode into an ASCII character (for the printable ones), put each character in a buffer, and echoed this out to the screen.  If you pressed Enter/Return, it echoed the buffer and then cleared it.  If you typed “END”, it would halt the processor.  It did handle the Shift key, so a 1 was always a 1 even when you held the Shift key; letters were always capital.  But all this code, including displaying the output and processing special characters like Return or Backspace, were handled in the driver.  Obviously this was just test code and not the final state of his keyboard driver, but it was the last bit of such code Fenollosa had in his tutorial, so this is what I had to start with.</p>
<p>The first thing I added was processing of the Shift key.  The keyboard interface itself doesn’t help you here.  Whenever a key is pressed or released, the keyboard interrupt service routine is called with the scancode of the key (which is different than the ASCII value), but otherwise that’s basically all you get.  So, for example, if someone pressed A, you don’t one value if they’re holding the Shift and another value if they’re not.  You just get the scancode (30 for the A, btw).  When they press the Shift, you get a separate call to the interrupt routine for the Shift key scancode.  So I added a static member to the keyboard driver called <code>shiftPressed</code>, and when the ISR was called with the Shift being pressed, I set this to ON (1).  When it was called with the Shift being raised (indicated by the same scancode + 128), I set this to OFF (0).  Then when the user typed an A, I translated this to <code>A</code> if the shiftPressed was ON and <code>a</code> if the shiftPressed was off.  Technically I did this by having two arrays of characters, with the scancode being the index to the array.  The first was when shiftPressed was OFF; the second when shiftPressed was ON.  This let me easily handle all the printable keys: The letters, numbers, and special characters like <code>$</code> and <code>/</code>.  Though I haven’t actually done so yet, that will be my same approach for the Ctrl and Alt keys.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought about supporting the Caps Lock key, but there’s a further complication with that.  The keyboard ISR is called when the Caps Lock is pressed and released, but that again has no impact on anything.  Of course, setting up another static variable to track the Caps Lock key is no big deal, but here’s the rub.  The Caps Lock has an LED indicator so the user can determine if it’s on or not.  One can control that using the data port interface of the keyboard, but I just haven’t figured out how to do that yet.  So for the moment the Caps Lock remains unused.</p>
<p>So after I did the above, it was just a matter of moving all the non-keyboard code out of the driver, and providing a routine for apps to call.  I created one called <code>waitForAscii</code>, which just waits until a printable key is pressed and returns the ASCII value.  It ignores anything like Ctrl or the function keys.  It also doesn’t work with the number pad yet, even though those are printable.  Even though it won’t return a Shift, it does modify the ASCII appropriately based on the status of the Shift key.</p>
<p>My future plan is to provide a mechanism for polling the keyboard that won’t block, and to give equivalent methods that include extended keys as well.  I also want to add support for the number pad even to the standard ASCII routines.  But these enhancements are for a little ways down the road.  My one blocking method supporting only ASCII keys will serve me for the moment as I begin my next task, building the basics of a command shell.</p>

            <p><img src="images/screen_output_1.png" alt><br>The screen device driver was the first external device I had to interface with, and much of the code that I used came from either Blundell or Fenelossa, although I certainly added my own changes and refinements.</p>
<p>The screen device driver was instructive because, while it is simple, it is the first time that you really notice that you’re in 32-bit Protected Mode.  The reason for this is because you lose access to BIOS.  In 16-bit mode, printing out some text on the display is as simple as populating a few registers and calling the appropriate interrupt.  </p>
<p>Here, for example, is my print_string_16.asm code:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print_string_16:			; Routine: output string in SI to screen</span><br><span class="line">	mov ah, 0Eh		        ; int 10h &apos;print char&apos; function</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">.repeat:</span><br><span class="line">	mov al, [bx]</span><br><span class="line">	cmp al, 0</span><br><span class="line">	je .done		        ; If char is zero, end of string</span><br><span class="line">	int 10h			        ; Otherwise, print it</span><br><span class="line">    add bx, 1</span><br><span class="line">	jmp .repeat</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">.done:</span><br><span class="line">	ret</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>If you’re not used to Assembly code, this may be a little difficult to read, but essentially you call the routine by placing the memory address of the string you want to print into the BX register.  The routine then goes character by character, printing each one until it finds a \0 (the standard terminator for a C-style string).  At that point, it returns.  The hard work is done by the BIOS when it calls <code>int 10h</code>, which tells it to display the character in register AL to the screen.</p>
<p>But the BIOS is 16-bit code, so as soon as you switch to Protected Mode, it’s not accessible.  There are two basic solutions to this.  First, you can switch back to 16-bit mode to call the BIOS, then switch back when you’re done.  Or, second, you can interface with the device using data ports.  The latter option is the one I went with, as the former seemed more difficult.</p>
<p>When accessing the video in this manner, you can use DMA to write data to the screen.  For a VGA monitor, video memory starts at 0xb8000, so if you want to write an ‘A’ to the upper left corner, you just put an A in that memory address.  Simple.  But each screen location is actually represented by two bytes, not one.  The second byte is the attributes byte, which determines background color, foreground color, and whether it’s blinking.  So to write to the next location on the screen, you’d have to write to location 0xb8002, not 0xb8001.  This method makes a lot of things simpler than the BIOS approach, especially if you want to be able to write text at specific locations on the screen with specific colors and such.  And text wrapping is automatically handled as well.  If you’re text wraps around to the next line, this just happens because the memory is linear.  So 0xb09e is the end of the first line and 0xb0a0 is the first character of the next line.  </p>
<p>The base routine for this is <code>print_char</code> in drivers/screen.c.  This is a private routine to the device driver, so even the kernel can’t call it.  It’s just the primitive that all the other routines call.  And as with most of the rest of my code at this point, most of it comes from Blundell/Fenollosa.  It basically does of the work of taking a col/row location and converting that to a memory address, and it assigns the character and the attribute byte to the appropriate locations.  </p>
<p>The other big thing that <code>print_char</code> handles is the location of the cursor.  When a character is printed, <code>print_char</code> will automatically set the cursor to the next location on the screen.  It does this by using the data ports for the VGA display device.  In <code>cpu/ports.c</code> are a set of generic routines to read/write bytes and shorts to device ports.  To change the location of the cursor, it sets the offset (the calculated offset from 0xb8000 based on the column and row) to the device, with the high byte being written to port 0x3d4 and the low byte to 0x3d5.  To find the location of the cursor, it just reads the bytes from thexe same ports.  This feature comes in handy, because then we can provide routines that don’t require a location.  You can print a message to the screen, and the cursor will move to the end of that message.  Then when you print another message, assuming you don’t provide a specific location, it just uses the cursor location to figure out where to put the new message.</p>
<p>One weakness of writing to video memory, however, is scrolling.  When text hits the bottom of the screen, we expect that the text just scrolls upward.  Using DMA, there’s no easy way to do this.  I wrote a function, handle_scrolling, that simply moves everything in video memory as if it were one line higher, then outputs the new bottom line.</p>
<p>The only other issue was the backspace.  Fenollosa had a routine, <code>kprint_backspace()</code>, that I largely used as is, but it didn’t seem to quite work for me.  When I tested it, hitting the backspace created an inverse dot character; it didn’t actually backspace.  I fixed that so it blanked out whatever character was then and moved the cursor back one full space.</p>

            <p><img src="images/dir_structure_1.png" alt><br>As I mentioned in my first post, HOSS is so far very heavily based on two different tutorials.  As a result, my structure largely matches that given in both of these, particularly Fenollosa’s.  </p>
<p>My boot loader can be found in the /boot subdirectory.  I largely followed Blundell’s tutorial here, with the main code being in boot_sect.asm.  As the extensions suggests, it is written in assembly and is assembled using NASM.  The other files here are just included in the main file, so they will not produce their own object files and thus don’t have to be linked.  One change I made from Blundell’s code is that I named the 16-bit print string procedure print_string_16, and the 32-bit version is just print_string.  At the time I was doing it, I thought I would be using the 32-bit version more, but of course once I boot, I start using the version developed in C (see screen.c in /drivers).</p>
<p>The boot process works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Basic 16-bit setup stuff (e.g., setup stack, print initial message).</li>
<li>Load next 15 sectors from disk into memory at 0x1000.  This loads the rest of our kernel.  This is just a very simple kernel loader.  It doesn’t know anything about a file system or anything like that.  It just takes all the bytes from the 15 sectors after the first and puts them in memory.  If there aren’t actually 15 sectors (which there aren’t when building just the basic os-image), it just loads as much as it finds.</li>
<li>Create simple GDT structurs.  This is a flat structure that creates one Data and one Code segment, and both map to the same memory.</li>
<li>Switch to protected mode.</li>
<li>Call the kernel entry point, which was loaded in step 2 to memory address 0x1000.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the boot process has completed, the boot loader will hand off control to the kernel, starting with the kernel_main function in kernel/kernel.c.  When the kernel is built, it is compiled to start at an offset of 0x1000 because that’s where the kernel is loaded by the boot process.  And it is compiled without linking any libraries from the development platform.  Thus everything has to be written from scratch without reusing any libraries that one would normally have available with C.  The kernel has it’s process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print out a message so I know it’s started (the kernel equivalent of “Hello, world!”)</li>
<li>Setup the IDT and the ISR’s.  To be honest, this is probably the one area of the boot/kernel that I am fuzziest on, at so far.  I understand the basic idea of an interrupt and that you need a routine to handle each interrupt.  As I understand the process, the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) is a structure that basically informs the cpu what Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) to call for each interrupt.  Most call the same ISR, a generic routine that just prints out a message.  This is primarily for error interrupts (e.g., invalid opcode or general protection fault) that will never happen because my code never has bugs! :)  Obviously at some point, I’ll need ISR’s to better handle these situations, but for the moment this will do.  The only other important thing that happens here is that I setup an ISR for the timer and the keyboard.  I’ll discuss more about the keyboard in a subsequent post.  As you might imagine, the code for the IDT and ISR configuration comes almost completely unchanged from Blundell.</li>
<li>A simple test loop that takes keyboard input and echoes it out to the screen.  This will be the beginning of my command shell, but for now it’s in kernel.c.  This routine allows me to test out the screen and keyboard device drivers, which is what I’ll discuss next.</li>

            <h1 id="HOSS"><a href="#HOSS" class="headerlink" title="HOSS"></a>HOSS</h1><h3 id="Harry’s-Operating-System-Software"><a href="#Harry’s-Operating-System-Software" class="headerlink" title="Harry’s Operating System Software"></a>Harry’s Operating System Software</h3><p>This is my attempt at writing an operating system.  My ambitions are low.  They do not extend beyond learning, experimenting, and having fun.  Writing a full operating system has been something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and for whatever reason I’ve finally decided to do so.</p>
<p>The original code was based on Nick Blundell’s unfinished book, “Writing a Simple Operating System – from Scratch”.  I found the pdf version online, and found it to be a good, relatively simple (as simple as writing an OS boot loader can be), and thorough introduction to getting an operating system booting on the i386 platform.  The boot code is largely based on this tutorial.</p>
<p>Blundell’s work had two big problems, however.  First, and most importantly, it wasn’t completed.  In fact, he had entires in the table of contents that had no corresponding text.  Clearly he had meant to write more, but life intrudes for us all.</p>
<p>The second big issue for me is that Blundell assumes the reader is using a Linux system.  I am using Mac OS, however.  Much of it worked out of the box (e.g., nasm), but other things did not  (e.g., linking multiple files).  For some of the issues, I was able to translate to the Mac, but it became more and more difficult.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found a github repository made by <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Fenollosa</a>.  This was a set of tutorials for writing an operating system with the Mac as the development platform.  It was largely based on Blundell’s tutorial, so his code was very compatible with what I already had.  And he had solved most of the problems I was already wrestline with.  The only downside was that his tutorials were a little out of date.  This only caused one issue, when building the cross-compiler.  The tutorial specified version 4.9 of gcc, and it wasn’t clear to me if this was intentional or just the latest at the time.  But the issue was sort of settled for me, because gcc 4.9 wouldn’t build.  I ended up upgrading to 6.5, and everything worked just fine.</p>
<p>Like Blundell, Fenelossa’s tutorial isn’t complete.  By the time you finish, you’ll have a booting OS that does basic screen output and can accept all-caps text input, but does nothing with it.  But it’s a very good start, and enough to get me working on a more complete kernel.</p>
<p>With that done, I can discuss the basic layout of HOSS!</p>
