My ambitions are low.  They do not extend beyond learning, experimenting, and having fun.  Writing a full operating system has been something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and for whatever reason I’ve finally decided to do so.</p>
<p>The original code was based on Nick Blundell’s unfinished book, “Writing a Simple Operating System – from Scratch”.  I found the pdf version online, and found it to be a good, relatively simple (as simple as writing an OS boot loader can be), and thorough introduction to getting an operating system booting on the i386 platform.  The boot code is largely based on this tutorial.</p>
<p>Blundell’s work had two big problems, however.  First, and most importantly, it wasn’t completed.  In fact, he had entires in the table of contents that had no corresponding text.  Clearly he had meant to write more, but life intrudes for us all.</p>
<p>The second big issue for me is that Blundell assumes the reader is using a Linux system.  I am using Mac OS, however.  Much of it worked out of the box (e.g., nasm), but other things did not  (e.g., linking multiple files).  For some of the issues, I was able to translate to the Mac, but it became more and more difficult.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found a github repository made by <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Fenollosa</a>.  This was a set of tutorials for writing an operating system with the Mac as the development platform.  It was largely based on Blundell’s tutorial, so his code was very compatible with what I already had.  And he had solved most of the problems I was already wrestline with.  The only downside was that his tutorials were a little out of date.  This only caused one issue, when building the cross-compiler.  The tutorial specified version 4.9 of gcc, and it wasn’t clear to me if this was intentional or just the latest at the time.  But the issue was sort of settled for me, because gcc 4.9 wouldn’t build.  I ended up upgrading to 6.5, and everything worked just fine.</p>
<p>Like Blundell, Fenelossa’s tutorial isn’t complete.  By the time you finish, you’ll have a booting OS that does basic screen output and can accept all-caps text input, but does nothing with it.  But it’s a very good start, and enough to get me working on a more complete kernel.</p>
<p>With that done, I can discuss the basic layout of HOSS!</p>
