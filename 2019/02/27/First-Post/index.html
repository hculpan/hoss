My ambitions are low.  They do not<br>extend beyond learning, experimenting, and having fun.  Writing a full operating<br>system has been something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and for whatever<br>reason I’ve finally decided to do so.</p>
<p>The original code was based on Nick Blundell’s unfinished book, “Writing a Simple<br>Operating System – from Scratch”.  I found the pdf version online, and found<br>it to be a good, relatively simple (as simple as writing an OS boot loader can<br>be), and thorough introduction to getting an operating system booting on the<br>i386 platform.  The boot code is largely based on this tutorial.</p>
<p>Blundell’s work had two big problems, however.  First, and most<br>importantly, it wasn’t completed.  In fact, he had entires in the<br>table of contents that had no corresponding text.  Clearly he had<br>meant to write more, but life intrudes for us all.</p>
<p>The second big issue for me is that Blundell assumes the reader is<br>using a Linux system.  I am using Mac OS, however.  Much of it<br>worked out of the box (e.g., nasm), but other things did not<br>(e.g., linking multiple files).  For some of the issues, I was able<br>to translate to the Mac, but it became more and more difficult.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found a github repository made by [Carlos Fenelossa]<br>(<a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial)</a>.  This was a set of<br>tutorials for writing an operating system with the Mac as the<br>development platform.  It was largely based on Blundell’s tutorial,<br>so his code was very compatible with what I already had.  And<br>he had solved most of the problems I was already wrestline with.<br>The only downside was that his tutorials were a little out of date.<br>This only caused one issue, when building the cross-compiler.  The<br>tutorial specified version 4.9 of gcc, and it wasn’t clear to me<br>if this was intentional or just the latest at the time.  But<br>the issue was sort of settled for me, because gcc 4.9 wouldn’t<br>build.  I ended up upgrading to 6.5, and everything worked just fine.</p>
<p>Like Blundell, Fenelossa’s tutorial isn’t complete.  By the time<br>you finish, you’ll have a booting OS that does basic screen output<br>and can accept all-caps text input, but does nothing with it.  But<br>it’s a very good start, and enough to get me working on a more<br>complete kernel.</p>
